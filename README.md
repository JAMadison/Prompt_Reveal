<h1>Prompt Reveal</h1>

Prompt Reveal is a user interface created with Python, tkinter & PILLOW that allows you to manage your AUTO1111 / Vlad styles.csv file, making it easier to work with AI-generated prompts. It is wrapped by pyinstaller to creat a singlefile for ease of use.

<h3>Installation and Usage</h3>

To use Prompt Reveal, simply download the program and unzip it to your <i><b>AUTO1111</b></i> root folder, where the styles.csv file is located. If you don't have a styles.csv file in the same directory as the Prompt Reveal executable, the program will create a new one for you when you run it for the first time.

Once you have saved the program and, if necessary, created a new styles.csv file, you can run it by double-clicking on the executable file. You can also create a desktop shortcut for easy access.
