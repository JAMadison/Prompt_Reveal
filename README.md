# Prompt_Reveal

Prompt Reveal is a program that allows you to manage your styles.csv file, making it easier to work with AI-generated prompts. With Prompt Reveal, you can add and delete styles, and even check if there is prompt meta-data on an image.

#Getting Started

To get started with Prompt Reveal, simply download and save the program in the same folder as your styles.csv file. This folder should be either your main AUTO1111 folder or Vlad folder.

***If you don't have a styles.csv file in the same directory as the Prompt Reveal executable, the program will create a new one for you when you run it for the first time.***

Once you have saved the program and, if necessary, created a new styles.csv file, you can run it by double-clicking on the executable file. You can also create a desktop shortcut for easy access.
